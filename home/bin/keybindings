# What's going on in here...
# The first section (clear control, etc.) unassigns whatever keys are
# used as to the Ctrl, Alt, and Super functions. Meaning if you just had those
# clear statements, you would not be able to Ctrl+C anymore. (tested to
# confirm).

# The next section defines the keys on the left and right sides. Each key
# has a numerical code attached to it, so basically:
#
#   64  -> The left "alt / option" key
#   133 -> The left "command" key
#   134 -> The right "command" key
#   108 -> The right "alt / option" key
#
# Note that these values refer to the physical keys on the keyboard. Meaning
# the codes are always sent when you press those keys, regardless of what
# the OS uses them for. So each "keycode X = ..." statement assigns a function
# to that key.

# The final section rebinds Ctrl, Alt, and Super.
# is the left key
